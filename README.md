# Modeling Mass Transfer in Binary Star Systems

	•	Objective: Investigate how mass transfer rates between stars in a binary system affect the evolution of the system and the likelihood of forming a supernova.
	•	What You Can Do:
  	•	Use existing models (e.g., MESA, a stellar evolution code) to simulate mass transfer in binary star systems with different stellar masses and orbital separations.
  	•	Study how variations in mass transfer rates affect the time it takes for the white dwarf to reach the Chandrasekhar limit and undergo a Type Ia supernova.
	•	Data/Tools:
  	•	MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) can simulate binary systems with mass transfer.
  	•	Python for analyzing simulation outputs and visualizing how the system evolves over time.
	•	Possible Extensions:
  	•	Investigate systems where the companion is a giant star or a neutron star.
  	•	Explore cases where the mass transfer is unstable, leading to phenomena like nova explosions instead of supernovae.
